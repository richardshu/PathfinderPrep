      "I needed to find a tutor for my youngest son who was struggling in AP Statistics. I was recommended Pathfinder Prep by a friend of mine, and I decided to give it a shot. My son began his weekly sessions, and we saw tremendous improvement in not only his grades, but overall comprehension of the subject material. I highly recommend Pathfinder Prep for any parent looking for a tutor for their child.",

My tutor was very focused and came prepared for each lesson with a plan. He was able to find my weaknesses and strenghten them through each lesson. I highly recommmend this program to all students looking to improve upon their academics.",
